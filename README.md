# Automated-DDOS-Attack-Detection-in-Software-Defined-Networking-SDN-using-Machine-Learning-Approach

SDN is a networking model that has redefined the term network by making network devices programmable. SDN enables network engineers to quickly monitor networks, centrally manage networks,quickly and accurately detect malicious traffic and link failure. In addition to the freedom that SDN offers, it is also susceptible to attacks like DDoS that can bring down the entire network. The research suggests utilising machine learning to separate DDoS attack traffic from benign traffic in order to counteract this attack. This paper's main contribution is the discovery of new features for DDoS attack detection.In order to generate the dataset and train machine learning algorithms, novel features are logged into a CSV file. Various DDoS attack detection research projects either employed non-SDN datasets or didn't provide their research findings to the public. The classification is carried out using a brand-new hybrid machine learning model.The hybrid Support Vector classifier with Random Forest (SVC-RF) model, according to the results, classifies the traffic with the greatest testing accuracy and a very low false alarm rate.
